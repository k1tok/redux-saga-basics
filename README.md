## Introduction

This project is designed to help you understand the basic concepts of Redux and Redux-Saga. It covers reducers, actions, useDispatch/useSelector, combining reducers, handling asynchronous actions with Redux-Saga, and more.

## Features

- State management with Redux: Centralized state handling using Redux.
- Use of useDispatch and useSelector hooks: Interact with the Redux store in functional React components.
- Combining multiple reducers: Merge multiple reducers with combineReducers.
- Handling asynchronous actions with Redux-Saga: Manage side effects with Sagas.
- Async operations: Implement asynchronous logic using Redux-Saga.
- Array handling in reducers: Techniques for managing arrays within Redux state.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/redux-saga-basics.git
cd redux-saga-basics
npm install
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the project locally with:

```bash
npm run dev
The application will be available at http://localhost:5173.
```

## Concepts Covered

- Reducers: Functions that handle state transitions based on actions.
- Actions: Objects that describe what happened and may contain data to update the state.
- useDispatch/useSelector: Hooks to interact with the Redux store in functional React components.
- CombineReducers: Utility to merge multiple reducers into a single reducer function.
- Async Operations with Redux-Saga: Middleware to handle asynchronous operations, such as API calls.
- Array Handling: Techniques for manipulating arrays within Redux state.
